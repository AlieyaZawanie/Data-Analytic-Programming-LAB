# Data Analytic Programming Lab

## Overview
This course introduces students to the practical application of open-source programming languages, specifically focusing on their use in Data Science. While the current trend is Python, the course remains flexible to explore other open-source languages as well.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: General Programming Practices and Tools
- Fundamental programming concepts and best practices.
- Topics include variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals), functions, and object-oriented programming principles.
- Introduction to essential programming tools used in Data Science such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), version control systems (e.g., Git), and package managers (e.g., pip for Python).

### Part 2: Data Analysis, Statistical Techniques, Machine Learning, and Presentation of Findings
- Deeper exploration of Data Science domain-specific aspects.
- Techniques for storing, manipulating, and analyzing data using various data structures and libraries/frameworks (e.g., Pandas).
- Introduction to statistical techniques including probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
- Overview of machine learning concepts and algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.
- Methods for effectively communicating and presenting findings derived from data analysis, including data visualization and storytelling with data.
